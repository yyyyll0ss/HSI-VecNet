# HSI-VecNet
We will expose the code of the hyperspectral image vectorization model HSI-VecNet.


# HSI vectorization datasets
We have uploaded the HSI vectorization datasets in our paper, including Indian Pines, Salinas Valley, WHU-Hi-LongKou, and WHU-Hi-HongHu.
Since the original datasets are too big to upload, we only upload the annotation files in COCO-instance format in this repo. The whole datasets can be downloaded in the website. URL：https://pan.baidu.com/s/19CSagulDBTs9nwcHvMahIw code：ikls
